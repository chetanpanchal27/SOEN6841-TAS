# Delivering Feedback by Jennifer Dyni

## Introduction
Delivering feedback—a vital capability for any team member—has not always come naturally to me. Initially, I believed simply voicing my perspectives would suffice. As I progressed, I realized the intricacies of delivering feedback that's both effective and empathetic. The journey taught me valuable lessons, transforming my approach to feedback.

## Learning and Growth
My initial attempts at influencing different directions were met with everything from indifference to outright anger. Through these experiences, I learned what *not* to do. To enhance my feedback skills, I delved into various tools and techniques, some of which include:

### 1. **Starting with Frameworks**
Frameworks offer structured templates to guide conversations. I've found them particularly useful for:

- **Appreciation:** Highlighting strengths and positive contributions.
- **Confrontation:** Addressing areas of improvement or concern.
- **Delegation:** Assigning tasks or responsibilities.

A frequently used framework is "Continue and Consider". It allows me to:

- Encourage strengths with phrases like "keep repeating" or "be confident with more".
- Address challenges using terms such as "consider changing" or "you can improve your effectiveness".

Each statement is followed by an open-ended question to foster a two-way conversation.

### 2. **Attune with Improv**
The non-verbal aspect of communication plays a significant role in conveying feedback. Improv techniques, like the "Mirror, Mirror" game, have enabled me to be more attuned to my own non-verbal cues and those of others. This game focuses on mirroring facial expressions, gestures, and eye contact, which aids in comprehending and resonating with the other person's viewpoint.

### 3. **Follow Up**
Feedback is a continuous process. It's crucial to make oneself available for subsequent discussions. This could be through scheduled meetings, impromptu discussions, coffee breaks, or a casual walk.

## Recommended Resources
For those interested in refining their feedback skills, I frequently turn to the following resources:
- *Fierce Conversations* by Susan Scott
- *Coaching Agile Teams* by Lyssa Adkins
- *Crucial Conversations* by Kerry Patterson and Joseph Grenny

## The Outcome
Employing these tools and techniques has been pivotal in my professional growth, transitioning me from an individual contributor to a full-time engineering team owner. With practice and preparation, the feedback process becomes more natural and effective, aiding in creating a positive and productive work environment.
