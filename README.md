# Distributed Teams Are Founded on Explicit Communication Channels
### Juan Pablo BuriticÃ¡

All teams past a certain size become distributed. This distribution can range across rooms, floors, buildings, or even cities. For teams that are part of fast-growing companies, this is a challenge that's hard to avoid.

### The Need for Explicit Communication Channels

1. **Productivity Benefits**: Explicit communication reduces ambiguity. When team members are certain about where to find information, they don't waste time searching for it. This helps in avoiding interruptions, such as the ill-timed chat notifications that break one's focus.

2. **Reducing Interruptions**: Opt for asynchronous communication for nonblocking items. Tools such as RFCs (Request For Comments) for architectural decisions can be valuable. These not only serve the immediate need but can also be reused as onboarding materials later on.

3. **Appropriate Use of Synchronous Channels**: Real-time idea exchange is essential in some scenarios. For these, use synchronous channels like group chats, video calls, or in-person meetings. It's essential to ensure everyone's availability, especially if team members are spread across different time zones.

4. **The Power and Perils of Multichannel Chats**: These tools are flexible but can lead to an "always-on" expectation. Ensure that you have protocols in place, like "quiet hours" or read-only announcement channels, to allow team members focused work time.

5. **Avoiding Information Gaps**: If you solely rely on in-person communication, as your team grows, you risk the proliferation of information gaps. This can lead to misalignment, demanding more time to manage communication. Defaulting to written communication helps in clear information distribution, promoting alignment.

6. **Preparedness for Fast Growth**: Building a culture around standardized communication practices aids fast team growth. Tools like RFCs or onboarding checklists can smoothen the transition for new hires, making them productive faster.

### Conclusion

While in-person communication may seem convenient initially, it's not scalable. Building a culture that's explicit about its communication types and channels, with a bias towards written mediums, prepares teams for rapid changes and growth. Thanks to the digital era, written communications are not bound by physical limitations, chance encounters, or intrusive interruptions.
