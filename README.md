# Distributed Teams Are Founded on Explicit Communication Channels

## Overview
This document presents a comprehensive analysis of the case study "Distributed Teams Are Founded on Explicit Communication Channels" by Juan Pablo Buriticá. It delves into the importance of explicit communication channels in managing distributed teams, especially in rapidly growing companies.

## Key Concepts
- **Importance of Explicit Communication:** Highlights how clear communication channels enhance productivity and management in distributed teams.
- **Asynchronous vs. Synchronous Communication:** Discusses the balance and appropriate use of different communication modes.
- **Multichannel Communication:** Explores the use of various communication tools and their impact on team dynamics.

## Case Study Summary
The case study emphasizes that all teams, regardless of size, become distributed at some point, whether across rooms, floors, buildings, or cities. As such, explicit communication channels become crucial in maintaining productivity and facilitating growth. The study further categorizes communication into asynchronous and synchronous channels, each suited for different scenarios. It also touches on the strategic use of multichannel chats and the importance of written communication in ensuring team alignment and preparedness for growth.

## Implementation in Modern Workplaces
- **Asynchronous Communication Tools:** Long-form documents for architectural decisions (RFCs), collaborative documents, forums, task-tracking tools, and email.
- **Synchronous Communication Tools:** Group chats, in-person meetings, and video calls.
- **Balancing Deep Focus and Accessibility:** Strategies for minimizing interruptions and ensuring focused work time.
