\section*{Abstract}

This case study, authored by Juan Pablo Buritic√°, emphasizes the critical importance of explicit communication channels in managing distributed teams. As teams grow and spread across various locations, maintaining productivity and efficient management becomes a challenge. The study highlights the necessity of deliberate selection of communication types and channels, particularly in the context of the increasing popularity of remote work. The primary advantage of such explicit communication strategies is enhanced productivity, as it reduces time wasted in seeking information and minimizes unnecessary interruptions.\\
\\The study suggests the use of asynchronous communication channels, like collaborative documents, forums, and emails, for non-urgent information exchange. These channels are effective for situations where real-time interaction is not crucial, thus aiding in avoiding disruptions and facilitating better focus. Conversely, when real-time idea exchange is essential, synchronous channels like group chats, in-person meetings, or video calls are recommended.\\
\\Additionally, the study discusses the dual role of multichannel chats that can function both synchronously and asynchronously but warns against the expectation of constant availability. The case study also addresses the pitfalls of reliance on in-person communication in growing teams, advocating for a culture that prioritizes written communications and explicit communication protocols. This approach not only aligns with the dynamics of remote work but also prepares teams for scalable growth, as exemplified by the use of comprehensive onboarding materials like RFCs and checklists.\\
\\In summary, this case study underlines the significance of explicit communication in distributed teams and presents strategies to optimize productivity, align team members, and prepare for organizational growth.

\section{Methods \& Methodology}

This section outlines the approaches used to investigate the problem of communication in distributed teams and the techniques employed for analyzing the results.

\subsection{Approach 1: Investigating Communication Breakdown}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Method: Conducted a series of interviews and surveys with members of global virtual teams, focusing on identifying the key factors leading to communication breakdown.
  \item Analysis: Utilized Decision Models to analyze the collected data, particularly focusing on trust, interpersonal relations, cultural differences, leadership, and technology \cite{ref1}.
  \item Technique: Employed quantitative methods to validate the impact of identified factors on communication efficiency and team performance.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Approach 2: Examining the Effect of Communication Delay and Medium}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Method: Conducted an experimental study with teams assigned roles of space crewmembers or flight controllers, collaborating on computer-based tasks with varying communication delays and mediums \cite{ref2}.
  \item Analysis: Analyzed performance variables including time to repair system failures and the number of incorrect repairs, alongside transcriptions of voice communications and logs of chats.
